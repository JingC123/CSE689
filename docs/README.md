### Description
For this project, I wanted to create a Archery game, that involves the simulation of the bow, bowstring, arrow, cloth as the shot target, and the interaction of all of them.  

And I also get the idea from Splatoon that change the color of the cloth in the areas where they were shot.

### Methodology
The project is developed based on the framework of Assignment 5, and all the objects were simulated by a bunch of partciles with Position Based Dynamics(PBD). Also, those objects were restrained by some physical condition, including: Gravity, Spring force, drawing force, Air Resistance and collision force.
  

### Result
I also add a function to adjust the drawing force by press keyboard. As shown in the video, we can see that with the greater drawing force, the drawing force is greater and The collision and reflection effect will be more severe. But when the drawing force is too large, The arrow will continue to move through the clothing with its direction and speed will be slightly affected.
